# ZJWT

I've been working around JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) a lot recently and learning the Zig programming language. I've also been working with Nix. Writing a JWT encoder / decoder in Zig with Nix for environment management seems like an apt project to combine some of the tools I've been dealing with and put them to use.

## Tasks

- [x] Initialize Git repo
- [x] Set up upstream repository on GitHub
- [ ] Write Base64 encoder / decoder (library)
- [ ] Read JWT RFC document

## Would be nice

- [ ] Create flake for project

## Features

- [ ] Decode JWT
- [ ] Encode JWT
